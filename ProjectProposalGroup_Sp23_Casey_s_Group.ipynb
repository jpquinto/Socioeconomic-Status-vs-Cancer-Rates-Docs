We seek to examine how such inequity disproportionately affects certain groups based on their socioeconomic status. Furthermore, We seek to examine what role these social factors play in the health industry, and more specifically with regards to cancer rates and cancer deaths.\n",

    "A study combined data from various sources to  look at how cancer rates, deaths, and survival differ between various poverty levels as well as race/ethnicity. One conclusion the study found was that people living in richer areas (which the study defines as having over 90% of people in that area not living in poverty) had a higher 5-year cancer survival than those living in more poverty-stricken areas (at most 80% of people in that area not living in poverty), with this difference being more than 10% [2].\n",

    "We expect that lower socioeconomic status is correlated with a higher cancer rate and cancer deaths, as people in this group would have less disposable income and therefore less access to the necessary medical resources to mitigate the risks of cancer, such as medical screenings. Additionally, people with a lower level of education may not be fully aware of the risk factors of cancer and the implications of cancer."
